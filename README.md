# Pok√©Project
## Why?
Honestly, just felt like doing it.

Jokes apart, I want to get better on React so it becomes my main framework.

## How?
I intend to do it using only React, fetching data from https://pokeapi.co

## Testing
There will probably be a link available, already hosted, for you to use it.

I use Freenom for hosting.

But if you clone it, just run `npm run dev`. 

# Warning
I use Replit, but unfortunately, I host personal projects in there and I don't own a *Hacker account* so I can set them as private. Therefore, I won't mention the link.
